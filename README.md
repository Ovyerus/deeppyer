deeppyer is an image deepfryer written in Python using [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org/)
and [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/).

NOTE: This *requires* at least Python v3.6 in order to run.

## How to use
You can either use deeppyer as a module, or straight from the command line.

### Command line usage
```
$ python deeppyer.py -h

usage: deeppyer.py [-h] [-v] [-o OUTPUT] [-f] FILE

Deepfry an image.

positional arguments:
  FILE                  File to deepfry.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -v, --version         Display program version.
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        Filename to output to.
  -f, --flares          Try and detected faces for adding lens flares.
```

By default, flares will try to be added to the image, unless you're using the CLI script,
in which case it is off by default.

### Program usage
```py
from PIL import Image
import deeppyer, asyncio

def main():
    img = Image.open('./foo.jpg')
    img = await deeppyer.deepfry(img)
    img.save('./bar.jpg')

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
